PROBLEM STATEMENT 
              The first way a system provides security to its resources and data, is by controlling access to the resources and the system itself. However, access control is more than just controlling which users (subjects) can access which computing and network resources. In addition, access control manages users, files and other resources. It controls user’s privileges to files or resources (objects). In access control systems various steps like, identification,authentication, authorization and accountability are taken before actually accessing the resources or the object in general. In early stages of computing and information technology,researchers and technologists realized the importance of preventing users from interfering each other on shared systems. Various access control models were developed. User’s identity was the main index to allow users to use the system or its resources. This approach was called Identification Based Access Control (IBAC). However, with the growth of the networks and the number of users, IBAC was found to be weak to defend such a large growth. Advanced concepts in access control were introduced which included owner/ group/ public. IBAC proved to be problematic for distributed systems as well. Managing access to the system and resources became hard and vulnerable to errors. A new method known as Role Based Access Control (RBAC) was introduced. Role based Access Control (RBAC) determines user’s access to the system based on the Job role. The role a user is assigned to be basically based on the least privilege concept. The role is defined with the least amount of permissions or functionalities that is necessary for the job to be done. Permissions can be added or deleted if the privileges for a role change. However, problems became apparent when RBAC was extended across administrative domains. And it proved difficult to reach an agreement on what privileges to associate with a role. Accordingly, a policy based access control known as Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) came into existence. In ABAC, access is granted on attributes that the user could prove to have such as date of birth or national number. However, reaching to an agreement on a set of attributes is very hard, especially across multiple agencies or domains and organizations. All access control methods rely on authentication of the user at the site, as well as, at the time of request. Sometimes they are labeled as authentication based access control. In all these methods, tight coupling among domains are required. This is done to merge identities or define the meaning of attributes or roles. 
SCOPE OF THE PROJECT  
                  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with ECC encryption for secure data sharing is a powerful framework that helps organizations manage and control access to their sensitive information. The objectives of implementing RBAC with ECC encryption in the context of secure data sharing, along with user revocation capabilities, include: 
Granular Access Control: 
Assign specific roles to users based on their responsibilities and job functions. Define fine-grained permissions associated with each role, ensuring users only have access to the information required for their tasks. 
Data Confidentiality: 
Use ECC encryption to protect the confidentiality of shared data. ECC is a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm that ensures secure data transmission and storage. 
Data Integrity: 
Implement mechanisms to maintain data integrity, ensuring that data remains unchanged and trustworthy throughout its lifecycle. 
Secure Data Sharing: 
Enable secure sharing of sensitive data within the organization by allowing access only to authorized users with the appropriate roles and permissions. 
User Authentication: 
Implement robust user authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized individuals can access the system. This helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. 
User Revocation: 
Provide the capability to revoke user access when necessary, such as when an employee leaves the organization or changes roles. This ensures that former users cannot access sensitive data after their roles change or they leave the organization.
